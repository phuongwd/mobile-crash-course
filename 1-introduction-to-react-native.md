Who are you and where are you from?! We're spending the entire week together, so some customary meet and greet. A short introduction. We'll talk about mobile engineering @ Wix and our mobile stack in general. We'll also talk about the main mobile products being developed and who's making them.



## `10:40 - 12:00` - Talk: ReactNative architecture - part 1 (with [Daniel Zlotin](mailto:danielz@wix.com))

Introduce the main aspects of React Native, why we are working in RN framework in Wix, differences between native and RN development that you should remember.
