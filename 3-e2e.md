# Day 3: E2E

## `10:00 - 10:55` - Talk: Guild and Open Source (with [Tal Kol](mailto:talkol@wix.com))
Our mobile stack is based on open source and we are very active contributors to this ecosysem. We've open sourced significant parts of our homebrewed infrastructure. What are our main projects? How does this work?

## `11:00 - 11:55` - Talk: Code Sharing (with [Aaron Greenwald](mailto:aarong@wix.com))
One of the key benefits of React Native is the ability to share JavaScript code between platforms (iOS and Android). Or even between mobile and React web projects. What are the best practices?

## `12:00 - 12:55` - Talk: The Mighty UI Lib (with [Eitan Sharabi](mailto:ethans@wix.com))
When everybody's code is running side by side in the same app, there's greater emphasis on a similar UI language and standardized UI components. We'll go over the [UI Lib](https://github.com/wix-private/wix-react-native-ui-lib) and see how to use it in our day to day.

## `13:00 - 14:00` - Lunch Break
Let's eat together and get to know each other. Don't run to your home teams.

## `14:00 - 15:00` - Talk: Detox and UI Automation Tests (with [Tal Kol](mailto:talkol@wix.com))
UI automation testing (E2E) is a key requirement for engineering at scale. What is the [protractor](http://www.protractortest.org) of the mobile world? [Appium](http://appium.io)? How is [detox](https://github.com/wix/detox) different? How do we deal with flakiness? What do tests look like?

## `15:00 - 18:30` - Workshop: Detoxify Your Project (with [Rotem Mizrachi](mailto:rotemm@wix.com))
Install [detox](https://github.com/wix/detox) on your project from the first day. Learn the testing API by going over detox's own suite of [E2E tests](https://github.com/wix/detox/tree/master/detox/test/e2e). Write a few end to end scenarios, practice the testing API and try to get a feel for its limitations.
