# Day 5: TDD

## `10:00 - 10:55` - Discussion: Meet the Guild (with the guild)
Every Thursday morning we have a guild-wide sync meeting. We'll use this opportunity to join in and meet some other members of the guild and hear them discuss some of the burning guild topics.

## `11:00 - 11:30` - Talk: Mobile Product What's New (with [Yonatan Biri](mailto:yonatanbi@wix.com))
We've been talking non-stop about engineering, now it's time for some product. We'll see some of the new mobile products that are currently in planning or active development and be inspired by the longer term product vision.

## `11:30 - 11:55` - Talk: Frontend & Backend Servers (with [Tal Kol](mailto:talkol@wix.com))
What are the special backend concerns of our mobile stack? The fact that app updates are optional mean we always deal with old versions and have to think about backwards compatibility. We'll discuss how to address this.

## `12:00 - 12:55` - Talk: TDD with RemX (with [Daniel Zlotin](mailto:danielzl@wix.com))
We believe that TDD is required for scaling our engineering and moving towards continuous delivery. Did you have fun trying to test Redux? Can we offer you an alternative workflow with less boilerplate and simpler tests? We'll show you what we're working on in a live coding session of Idea 1 from the first day.

## `13:00 - 14:00` - Lunch Break
This is the last day, if you really want to eat with your home teams it's ok :)

## `14:00 - 17:30` - Workshop: TDD Rewrite (with [Daniel Zlotin](mailto:danielzl@wix.com))
Try to apply the workflow demonstrated in the last talk on your project from the first day. You can start fresh and implement a single scenario from start to finish with real TDD. This means not adding new code unless a failing test previously indicated that you must. If you're not used to TDD, our mentors will be around to help.

## `17:30 - 18:30` - Discussion: Summary & Feedback (with [Tal Kol](mailto:talkol@wix.com))
Last hour of the last day. We'll pull out some beers and talk about the week we've just had. It's your stage to give feedback on the course and on the stack. Where do you see the main pains of development? Where would you like the mobile guild to concentrate its efforts?
