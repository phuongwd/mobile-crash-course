## `13:00 - 13:55` - Talk: Experiments, BI & Monitoring (with [Noam Cocos](mailto:noamc@wix.com))
What's different for [Petri](https://github.com/wix/petri) experiments on mobile? How do we report BI on mobile? What are the tools we use to monitor our apps in production? We're going to see some code and experience the tools involved in live demos.


## `14:00 - 14:55` - Talk: Code Sharing (with [Aaron Greenwald](mailto:aarong@wix.com))
One of the key benefits of React Native is the ability to share JavaScript code between platforms (iOS and Android). Or even between mobile and React web projects. What are the best practices?


## `15:00 - 18:00` - Workshop: Integrate with OneApp (with [Lev Vidrak](mailto:levv@wix.com) & [Artal Druk](mailto:artald@wix.com) )
Now that we are familiar with OneApp's architecture we will integrate our demo-project to be a tab inside OneApp. A mini app (what we call a module) - you can follow step-by-step tutorial [here](https://github.com/wix-private/awesome-mobile-framework/blob/master/AddingNewModuleAsTabToOneApp.md)
