# Day 2: TDD 

## `10:00 - 10:40` - Talk: Navigation - Idea, Pains & Roadmap (with [Ran Greenberg](mailto:rang@wix.com) & [Guy Carmeli](mailto:guyc@wix.com ))
Navigation includes the entire skeleton of the app - core UI components like the navigation bar, tab bar and side menu; and how we move between screens. How is mobile navigation different from web? How's our [native library](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) different from the stock one?



## `10:50 - 12:00` - Talk: Testing Redux (with [Yedidya Kennard](mailto:yedidyak@wix.com))
The base of the testing pyramid consists of unit tests. How well does our stack accommodate them? We'll see how to write tests for our business logic with [redux-testkit](https://github.com/wix/redux-testkit) in a live coding session showing actual test implementations for each of Redux's building blocks (reducers, selectors, thunks, etc).


## `12:00 - 13:00` - Lunch Break

## `13:00 - 13:55` - Talk: TDD with remx (with [Daniel Zlotin](mailto:danielzl@wix.com))
We believe that TDD is required for scaling our engineering and moving towards continuous delivery. We will show how it is done more easily with remx.


## `14:00 - 18:00` - Workshop: TDD Rewrite your project (with [Daniel Zlotin](mailto:danielzl@wix.com) & [Elad Bogomolny](eladbo@wix.com))
We will re-write the example project you did yesterday following TDD principles!

We will also discuss the importance of the testing pyramid.
