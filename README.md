# Mobile Crash Course
Crash course for engineers in Wix to start working on the mobile stack. Split into 5 days.

### [0. Preliminaries](0-preliminaries.md)
Before starting the crash course, you should familiarize yourself with some basic concepts. Feel free to skip the parts you already know.

### [1. Hands-on Dive](1-hands-on-dive.md)
This is the first official day of the crash course. In order to get the juices running, we'll spend most of the day working on a hands-on project. We'll use this project as a baseline for the other workshops in the next few days.
