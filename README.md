# Mobile Crash Course
Crash course for engineers in Wix to start working on the mobile stack. Split into 5 days.

### [0. Preliminaries](0-preliminaries.md)
Before starting the crash course, you should familiarize yourself with some basic concepts. Feel free to skip the parts you already know.

### [1. Hands-on Dive](1-hands-on-dive.md)
This is the first official day of the crash course. In order to get the juices running, we'll spend most of the day working on a hands-on project. We'll use this project as a baseline for the other workshops in the next few days.

### [2. The Basics](2-the-basics.md)
After a few talks about the basics (native vs JS, CI and navigation), we'll have a show & tell where we'll each go over a single scenario in yersterday's code from start to finish and get some group feedback.

### [3. E2E](3-e2e.md)
After some more general talks (open source, code sharing and UI lib), we'll experiment with UI automation testing (E2E) and try to test our apps from first day with detox.

### [4. The Gory Details](4-the-gory-details.md)
We'll spend the first half of the day learning about modules in One App, hearing some performance horror stories and seeing experiments, BI and monitoring. The second half is dedicated for unit tests in Redux.

### [5. TDD](5-tdd.md)
