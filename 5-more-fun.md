# Day 5: More Fun


## `10:00 - 10:55` - Discussion: Meet the Guild (with the guild)
Every Thursday morning we have a guild-wide sync meeting. We'll use this opportunity to join in and meet some other members of the guild and hear them discuss some of the burning guild topics.

## `11:00 - 11:50` - Talk: Mobile Product What's New (with [Dror Biran](mailto:drorb@wix.com ))
We've been talking non-stop about engineering, now it's time for some product. We'll see some of the new mobile products that are currently in planning or active development and be inspired by the longer term product vision.


## `12:00 - 13:00` - Lunch Break

## `13:00 - 17:00` - Workshop: TDD Kata (with [Daniel Zlotin](mailto:danielzl@wix.com))

We will use [this repo](https://github.com/wix/tdd-katas) to train our TDD brains and fingers, and learn the benefits of practicing katas.

## `17:00 - 19:00` - Discussion: Summary, Feedback & Beer
We'll pull out some beers and talk about the week we've just had. It's your stage to give feedback on the course and on the stack. Where do you see the main pains of development? Where would you like the mobile guild to concentrate its efforts?
